					<h1>Release Notes</h1>
					<h2>Version <span class="version">2011.01.02.1054</span><span class="release_date">January 2, 2011</span></h2>
					<h3>Features Added</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Implemented support for measurement units other than the GURPS standard feet/inches and pounds.
							User-entered values (including those entered into equipment, for example) can be in any of the
							supported units. The program will not convert these values â€“ it leaves them as entered. However,
							anywhere the program calculates values from these, a preference controls what unit is used for
							the end result. Because of the bias of the rules for imperial units, using metric isn&#039;t a
							clean proposition using this feature, but it is possible now. This covers:
							<ul>
								<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/gcs-java/feature-requests/103">Feature #103</a>:
									Allow Height &amp; Weight in metric units.</li>
								<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/gcs-java/feature-requests/95">Feature #95</a>:
									Support metric units.</li>
								<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/gcs-java/feature-requests/82">Feature #82</a>:
									Display weight in tons.</li>
								<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/gcs-java/feature-requests/63">Feature #63</a>:
									Add metric support for height field.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Implemented <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/gcs-java/feature-requests/115">Feature #115</a>:
							Expanded the valid range for the size modifier.</li>
						<li>Implemented <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/gcs-java/feature-requests/112">Feature #112</a>:
							Preference to turn off automatic naming.</li>
						<li>Added support for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/gcs-java/feature-requests/100">Feature #100</a>:
							Advantage containers show point subtotal. The &#039;Group&#039; container used to be treated
							specially for point display purposes. Removed this so they all now display a summary of
							points of their contained items.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Bugs Fixed</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Fix for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/gcs-java/bugs/11">Bug #11</a>: Relative skill levels do
							not reflect Talent. Changed the code to apply all skill bonuses to the relative skill level
							calculation. Since this effectively reduces the calculation to Skill Level - Stat (but without
							encumbrance), I don&#039;t see why RSL is even needed if this is indeed the way it is intended to
							be done. However, since 99% of the published examples do it this way and Kromm has weighed in
							that this is the way it is intended, I&#039;ve made the change, silly though it may be.</li>
						<li>Fix for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/gcs-java/bugs/70">Bug #70</a>: Error in zero point
							calculation.</li>
						<li>Put the modifier list in a scroll panel so that it will be usable even on small monitors.</li>
						<li>Fix for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/gcs-java/bugs/63">Bug #63</a>: Text obeys system
							colors; background doesn&#039;t. I now force the character sheet text and backgrounds to have
							the colors they were intended to have, regardless of the current system theme. This still
							leaves the interface a bit jarring in some places, but everything should now be readable if
							you muck with the standard system colors.</li>
						<li>Changed the Windows batch file for gcs to extract the path name so that launching didn&#039;t
							depend on being in the correct directory. Not sure this works for all versions of Windows.
							Feedback would be appreciated.</li>
						<li>Fix for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/gcs-java/bugs/73">Bug #73</a>: Points being
							mis-calculated with some combinations of modifiers. Applied a patch from Matt Fowles plus
							some additional fixes of my own.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Miscellaneous Changes</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Updated the HTML template layout to use points rather than pixels and forced a width that
							will fit on both Letter and A4 paper.</li>
						<li>Revised the splash screen and about box code to allow the informational data to be rendered
							at runtime.</li>
						<li>Switched to using reflection to deal with the Mac-specific portions of the app to eliminate
							the dependency on AppleJavaExtensions.jar.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Data File Changes</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Added libraries for Action, High Tech &amp; Ultra Tech contributed by Zachary Spector.</li>
						<li>Cleaned up some traits with variants.</li>
						<li>Fix for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/gcs-java/bugs/74">Bug #74</a>: Errors in the Dungeon
							Fantasy data file.</li>
						<li>Fix for <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/gcs-java/bugs/71">Bug #71</a>: Hide spell prereq
							incorrect.</li>
						<li>Fix various typos.</li>
						<li>Fix many techniques that were marked as being Average when they should have been marked
							as being Hard.</li>
						<li>Lots of miscellaneous corrections contributed by many different people.</li>
					</ul>
