				<h2>Ancient Releases</h2>
				<p>For those of you with very old Macs, I've kept around some ancient versions of GCS that you can try.
					These versions were written for the 3rd Edition GURPS rules.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="/downloads/ancient/gcs-2.2.3.sit">Version 2.2.3</a>: Supports PowerPC processors running Mac OS 8.5+</li>
					<li><a href="/downloads/ancient/gcs-1.0.5.sit">Version 1.0.5</a>: Supports 68K and PowerPC processors</li>
